###Introduction

Cπ is the lingua franca of the computer world. It is a general purpose programming language and often used in systems level programming. In this project we will be implementing Cπ (Cpi) which is a subset of the C language. It will be designed to compile to ARM V6 assembly with the target platform being the Raspberry Pi (RPi) . Cπ will use the GNU assembler(as/gas), linker(ld) and linaro cross toolchain (gcc-linaro-arm-linux-gnueabihf-raspbian) for assembly to binary code generation on the RPi.
###Key Features

Cπ will be an easy language to learn for those familiar with ANSI C. The generated ARM V6 assembly will be completely unoptimized.

Keywords
Cπ will contain the following keywords

    int
    char
    void
    return
    else
    while
    goto
    if
    scan
    print
    struct


###Primitive Data Types
    int:		32 bit integers
    char:		8 bit character
    int\*:		32 bit pointer to an integer value
    char\*:	32 bit pointer to a character value
    void\*:	32 bit pointer to a castable value

###Aggregate Data Types

These will be defined/declared as in C collecting primitive datatypes.

    array
    structure
    Operators
    Operator precedence will follow standard orders of operation and will mimic ANSI C. 

For arrays, structure definition, separate expressions
    []	Array indexing
    *	Unary * for pointer dereferencing
    .	For accessing structure members through a structure variable
    ->	For accessing structure members through a structure pointer
    &	Returns address of a datatype

    ==	Returns an int (1 if equality holds, 0 otherwise)
    !=	Returns an int (0 if equality holds, 1 otherwise)
    ^	Bitwise XOR operator
    ~	Bitwise NOT operator
    &	Bitwise AND of 2 numbers
    |	Bitwise OR of 2 numbers
    !	Logical NOT operator
    &&	Logical AND operator
    ||	Logical OR operator
    =	Assignment operator
    >	greater than operator
    <	less than operator
    >>	Shift right operator
    <<	Shift left operator
    +	Addition Operator
    -	Subtraction Operator
    *	Multiplication Operator
    /	Division Operator
    %	Modulo Operator

###Functions
Function scope will be limited to the section enclosed in braces ({ and }). A
main function will exist where code execution will start. Cπ will not support
passing command line arguments to a program. Function arguments will be passed
by value. Function arguments and return values will support passing pointers
and functions can be recursive. To communicate to an external console, print()
and scan() function will be built into the language. 
###Control Flow
Conditional statements such as if, else, and else if will be implemented according to ANSI C guidelines. Labels and goto statements will be supported as well as while loops.

###Variable scoping
Global datatypes will be supported if declared outside of the scope of all functions. Normal C scoping rules apply in functions and blocks.

###Comments
We will be supporting both single line and block comments. Block comments cannot be nested inside of each other.

    //	Comment
    /*	Beginning of Block Comment
    */	End of Block Comment

###Syntax Examples

####HelloWorld.cpi
    int main() {
        print(“Hello World”);
               return 0;
    }


####BinarySearch.cpi
    int binary_search(int array[], int start, int end, int element) {

           if (start > end)
                  return -1;
           else {
                  int mid = ((start + end)/2);
                  int temp = array[mid];
                  if (temp == element) {
                         return mid;
                  } else if (temp > element) {
                         return binary_search(array, start, mid - 1, element);
                  } else {
                         return binary_search(array, mid + 1, end, element);
                  }
           }
    }

    int bin_search(int array[], int size, int element) {
           return binary_search(array, 0, size - 1, element);
    }

    int main() {
          int arr[] = {1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512};
          int size = 10;
          int target = scan();
          int result = bin_search()
          print(“Binary search of “, target, “in arr returns”, bin_search(arr,size,target));
          return 0;
    }



###Unsupported features from ANSI C:
    Floating point variables and operations - no double and float.
    short and long integers.
    Unsigned integers
    break and continue
    Enums.
    sizeof and Ternary operators
    Increment and decrement operators.
    Const 
    for, do-while and switch statements.
    Storage class specifiers - auto, register, volatile static and extern.
    Multi-file compilation and linkage.
    Preprocessing - no # directives.
    Function pointers and void pointers.
    Function inlining.
    Static and volatile function.
    Variable function arguments - Ellipsis (...)
    No type casting
